# Project: Social media blog API

## Background 

When building a full-stack application, we're typically concerned with both a front end, that displays information to the user and takes in input, and a backend, that manages persisted information.

This project will be a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application will function as a micro-blogging or messaging app. In our hypothetical application, any user should be able to see all of the messages posted to the site, or they can see the messages posted by a particular user. 

This API includes the ability to process actions such as user login and creation, message creations, updates, retrievals and deletions.

Techonologies used include Javalin, Jackson ObjectMapper, and JDBC. 

To start the project, run the main method in Main.java inside the Util folder.
